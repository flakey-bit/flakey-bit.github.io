First post in a series covering practical functional-programming ideas for everyday LoB application developers

I've recently read the book [Functional programming in C#](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp) by Enrico Buonanno - I highly recommend reading it. This post (series?) will concentrate the ideas from the book that _I_ found most valuable.

I'll try to avoid mentioning the dreaded "m" word (...Monad) - for a while at least.

Topics:

* Introduction (not "all-or-nothing", functional core with imperative shell. Yes it's rooted in maths)
* Functions as data
* Pure functions
* Why (unchecked) exceptions are evil
*
